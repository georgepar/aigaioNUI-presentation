abstract={Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications enable networked devices and services to exchange information and perform actions seamlessly without the need for human intervention. They are viewed as a key enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous applications, like mobile healthcare, telemetry, or intelligent transport systems. We survey existing work on mobile M2M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with a wide range of embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M2M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network. We conclude that, in order for their use to the feasible in terms of a normal depletion time of a smartphone's battery, it is a good advice to maximize the collection of data necessary to be transmitted from nearby sensors, and maximize the intervals between transmissions. More research is required to devise energy efficient transmission methods that enable the use of smartphones as mobile gateways.},

abstract={Consumer-grade range cameras such as the Kinect sensor have the potential to be used in mapping applications where accuracy requirements are less strict. To realize this potential insight into the geometric quality of the data acquired by the sensor is essential. In this paper we discuss the calibration of the Kinect sensor, and provide an analysis of the accuracy and resolution of its depth data. Based on a mathematical model of depth measurement from disparity a theoretical error analysis is presented, which provides an insight into the factors influencing the accuracy of the data. Experimental results show that the random error of depth measurement increases with increasing distance to the sensor, and ranges from a few millimeters up to about 4 cm at the maximum range of the sensor. The quality of the data is also found to be influenced by the low resolution of the depth measurements.},

abstract     = {<p>We propose a new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions of body
                joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take an
                object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation
                that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel
                classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the
                classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc.
                Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by
                reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes.
The system runs
                at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy
                on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several
                training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with
                related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton
                nearest neighbor matching.</p>},
